#### Overview: To pinpoint new disease-relevant cell states in SLE and their detailed molecular profiles, we applied the deepest investigation strategy for single-cell data, cellular and molecular fine mapping, to the largest-scale multimodal SLE datasets, comprising ~2.1 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 232 SLE cases and 114 healthy controls. Among 123 fine-grained cell states in 27 cell types, we discovered that previously uncharacterized cell states, such as GZMK+GZMH+HLA-DR+ effector memory CD8+ T cells (double-positive [DP] EMCD8) and ARHGAP15+FOXO1+ T cells, expanded especially in severe SLE. Based on our new statistical model (ScQuaD), which efficiently dissects gene signatures reflecting cell state abundance (quantitative change) and single-cell-level gene dysregulation (qualitative change) within each conventional cell type, we found that key biological processes and genetic risks of SLE were linked to these expanded cell states. Finally, by combining multimodal in-silico analyses, CRISPR perturbations, and cellular function assays, we identified cell-state-specific transcriptional regulators, key surface proteins, T cell receptor features, and cis-regulatory elements.
